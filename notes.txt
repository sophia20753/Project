cust instruction: size of kernel, address of kernel
cust instruction: memory address of first element of matrix, input/output flag
cust instruction: compute

chisel algorithm (1): manually input using poke, test 3x3 convolution
chisel algorithm (2): test zero padding 
chisel algorithm (3): test tile by tile convolution for 32x32



tiled:
output stationary -> load extra input, each output tile only loaded once
input stationary -> input loaded only once, output MAC'd for multiple iterations (less favourable as requires reading output and then adding)
